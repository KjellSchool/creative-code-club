School is not only a place where you learn new subjects, but also where you grow as a person. Every day, you discover something different: from solving math problems to learning how to work together with classmates. Teachers guide you, support you, and encourage you to keep trying, even when things aren’t easy. At school, you build friendships, develop new interests, and start to understand the world better.
Step by step, school helps you prepare for your future.
